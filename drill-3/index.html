            <p>Consider hiding the status bar-and all other app UI-while people are actively
            viewing full-screen media.  If you hide the status bar, be sure to let people retrieve
            it (and the appropriate app UI) with a single tap.  Unless you have a compelling
            reason to do so, avoid defining a custom gesture to redisplay the status bar
            because useres are unlikely to discover such a gesture or to remember it.</p>
